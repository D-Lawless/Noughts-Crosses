I have created two versions of the function as requested, one that checks for the basics of
if the player playing 'X' has won, if the player playing 'O' has won and if the outcome is yet to be decided.

The other also includes a check for if the game is a tie and also if the board is invalid, however to achieve this
I had to implement a nested for loop which caused the time complexity to rise.

I have created and added a test case for a variety of tests to ensure my code was fully functioning correctly, one for either function.
To implement these tests you can run the following command in the terminal:

    gradlew clean build
